<p>This web app is hosted by Stackify to give potential users a "hands on" way to try out Stackify. It is monitored in the Stackify Sandbox account, which you can try out
    <a href="#">here</a> or if you already have an account set up, from your Stackify portal <a href="https://s1.stackify.com/Manage/Sandbox">here.</a>
</p>

<p>This app is built with ASP.Net MVC 5 and is fully functional. But in order to show off the capabilites of Stackify, you'll find that certain functions do not work! This is so that exceptions and errors
    can be seen from within the Stackify portal.
    </p>

<h3>If you're curious about the source code, or want to host this app yourself and monitor in your own account, just fork it on Github <a href="https://github.com/stackify-dev/StackifySandbox.Net">here.</a></h3>
